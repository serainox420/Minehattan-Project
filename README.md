# Minehattan Project

Welcome to the Minehattan Project, where Minecraft meets absolute chaos and creativity! This repository houses a massive collection of Minecraft items, each with excessively modified NBT tags. These items can lead to some truly insane and unpredictable outcomes in your Minecraft world.

## What's Inside?

- **World-Eating Command Blocks:**
  > Ever wanted a command block that can devour your entire world? We've got you covered!

- **Lethal Creative Potions:**
  > Even in Creative mode, you'll want to be careful with these splash potions. They can bring doom to anything in their radius.

- **Infinite Shulkerboxes:**
  > Imagine shulkerboxes stacked within themselves millions of times! (Don't throw into lava!).

...and many more!

## How to Use

Using the Minehattan Project items is simple. Just add them to your Minecraft world using commands or an inventory editor. Be prepared for unexpected results.

**Important Note:** 
> Be cautious when using these items, as they can have unintended consequences and may even corrupt your world. Use them at your own risk!
