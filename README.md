# The Minehattan Project

The Minehattan project is a project to bring nuclear-tier weaponry to Minecraft, in the form of NBT files that can be easily imported into existing worlds or servers. 

Half Half sick half dangerous stuff inside.
From proximity spawner bombs to overflow entity cap or freeze you with particle overflow.
To literal world eaters... unleashed once are one way ticket to tell your target server Adios!
